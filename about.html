          <p>
            This project is a research project for the purpose of graduation at the University of Texas Permian Basin.
            This class is titled COSC 4395 Research. This is for section 001 in spring of 2024 and instructed by Vladan Vuckovic.
            This class was designed to be completely independent without any peer assistance. The purpose of this class is to teach a senior
            student the proper time management to research a creative project and then develop that project similar to a real world scenario.

          <p class="subtitle">Initial Thoughts</p>
          <p>
            In the beginning when embarking on this project I knew i wanted to create a game. I had never created a game from scratch.
            With my background in web development throughout my coursework (Svelte, React, Amazon Amplify, ThreeJS, LAMP) I wanted to create a simple project using javascript as a base.
            Upon deciding what I wanted the foundation of my game to be built on, I choose the fighting game genre as my focus. Initially this was the intent of this game. However,
            over the course of development I found that developing a state machine from scratch was way too much for me. As I type this i decided to change scope two weeks before my presenation.
            With the little time I have left I am going to attempt to make my own version of a famous app known as Temple Run.
